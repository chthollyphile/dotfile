Dotfile for my Omarchy Linux setup.

tested in Omarchy 3.1.7.

## External dependencies

- cava
- fish
- waylyrics
- toilet
- lolcat
- mpvpaper
- awww

## awww

I use `awww` instead of the default `swaybg` for background switching.

To set up the awww daemon, please refer to the instructions in the [awww repository](https://codeberg.org/LGFae/awww) and follow its documentation.  

After setup, copy `extra/omarchy-theme-bg-next-aw` to `/home/your-username/.local/share/omarchy/bin` for it to work.

> **Note:** Replace `your-username` with your actual username in the path above to avoid errors.
